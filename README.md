Application used as study case for JAMstack, using next.js with typescript, stripe
for checkout and prismic CMS, also implemented social login with github, using next-auth,
FaunaDB was the database used in this study case.

Observations important, webhook from subscribe button is not active, wich means that the button is not functional,
since the objective was for study only the code is implemented as the documantation specify,
the full configuration for production was not set, so if you want to replicate using the
version in package.json is possible and functional.

The login however is functional in prodution since will not affect anyone or monetary values.
